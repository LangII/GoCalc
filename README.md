# GoCalc
\
**Overview:**\
\
Developing artificial intelligence to play the board game of Go, where the program's primary purpose is not necessarily be a great Go player, but instead to explain to users why the AI makes the decisions that it does, and explain where the information to make the decisions come from.\
\
Primary external libraries used:  kivy, tensorflow, keras, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.\
