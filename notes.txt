***   DECISION MAKING   ***

decision calculator object (2020-09-18):
- An object with many observation model object inputs and a single final decision output.

decision observation model object (2020-09-18):
- An object with a single live input, many settings inputs, and a single results output.
- settings inputs:
	- data type:  (incremental, categorical, bool) Determines how variable results are calculated
	and how variable inlfuences the decision of the calculator.
	- influence:  How important this observation is to it's parent calculator.
	-






***   DECISION MODEL RELATIONSHIPS   ***

decision_value = integer (value of decision)
iteration_value = integer (value of decision for this iteration)
score_accuracy = key integer (iteration of change): value integer (accuracy of score)

Model needs to have pattern recognition from one iteration of model to the next.
